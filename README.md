# 2.1- Literature Review
Haemoglobin assessment is crucial for understanding an individual's health, yet conventional methods involving invasive blood tests pose barriers to effective healthcare, including discomfort and a lack of continuous monitoring. This literature review explores the emerging field of non-invasive haemoglobin measurement, which represents a shift towards patient-centric healthcare. It examines the methodologies and technologies developed to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches, providing insights into the benefits, limitations, and transformative potential of these innovative techniques. The review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of haemoglobin assessment, with the ultimate goal of enhancing healthcare accessibility and proactive management.

# 2.2- CALCULATION OF HAEMOGLOBIN LEVEL
**Haemoglobin Measurement**: Haemoglobin measurement stands as the central focus of this innovative project, and for good reason. Haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in our blood, serves as a paramount indicator of overall health. 
Accurate and timely haemoglobin assessment is essential for the early detection and management of various medical conditions, including anaemia, blood disorders, and certain chronic illnesses.

**Unique Purpose:** What sets this project apart is its unique purpose in redefining Haemoglobin measurement as a non-invasive procedure. Traditional methods of Haemoglobin assessment involve the extraction of blood through needles, a process fraught with discomfort and fear, particularly for individuals grappling with trypanophobia (fear of needles). By introducing a non-invasive approach, this project eliminates the distressing element associated with needle-based tests. The process is made more comfortable and accessible, allowing even those with severe needle-related fears to easily undergo Haemoglobin monitoring.

**User-Friendly:** The non-invasive nature of this innovation makes it inherently user-friendly, creating a healthcare experience that is more accessible and welcoming to all. It empowers individuals to take charge of their health, offering a seamless and painless method for immediate and continuous Haemoglobin assessment.

# 2.3 ALGORITHM:-
**2.3.1 SpO2 Measurement (Algorithm-I) :-**
Role in the Project: SpO2 (oxygen saturation) measurement is the linchpin in this project, serving as the bridge that connects non-invasive technology to the calculation of Haemoglobin levels. As a non-invasive method, SpO2 measurement assesses the percentage of oxygen-bound Haemoglobin in the blood.

How it Works: This algorithm works by calculating the ratio between the Infrared & Red LED readings which is known as the R-index. And by using the Calibration Curve & R-index, SpO2 value is calculated. The relation used to calculate it is SpO2 value = calibration curve(R-index).

Application in Haemoglobin Measurement: The application of SpO2 measurement is essential in the project's pursuit of non-invasive and real-time Haemoglobin level estimation. It not only ensures the comfort and convenience of healthcare assessments but also extends its inclusivity to individuals who might have otherwise avoided necessary blood tests. SpO2 plays a central role in making healthcare more accessible, user-friendly, and ultimately more effective in the calculation of Haemoglobin levels.

**2.3.2 Haemoglobin Measurement (Algorithm-II) :-**
Role in the Project: Haemoglobin measurement serves as the central focus of this project, embodying its significance in healthcare. Its role is very important as this projectâ€™s purpose is to calculate the Haemoglobin Level in blood.
How it Works: Elsevier Inc. has laid claim to an equation utilized for the detection of functional anemia. This equation is currently implemented within our code, enabling us to identify functional anemia by extracting Spo2 and hemoglobin data from the body sensor.

# 2.4 RESEARCH ISSUES/OBSERVATIONS: -
The project faces several critical research challenges, including the need to establish robust calibration and standardization processes for consistent results. Addressing the variability in the relationship between SpO2 and Haemoglobin levels, along with considerations like temperature, pH, and individual variations, is vital. Ensuring user-friendly interfaces, data security, and privacy protection are additional concerns. Regulatory compliance and real-time monitoring reliability must be meticulously addressed. The project also aims to gauge user acceptance, accessibility, data accuracy, precision, and cost-efficiency while conducting clinical validation studies to confirm the reliability of the non-invasive method in diagnosing anaemia and other Haemoglobin-related conditions. Tackling these research issues is integral to the successful implementation and adoption of this groundbreaking healthcare technology.
